1. First run receiver:
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/receiver/libudt.so
$ ./path/to/receiver/appserver

2. Then run sender (fixed port number 9000 is used)
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/sender/libudt.so
$ ./path/to/sender/gradient_descent_pcc_client receiver_ip 9000




In the output logs at the sender side,
column 1: seconds since connection starts
column 2: average sending rate within the 1-sec period
column 3: average rtt within the 1-sec period
column 4: total number of packets sent since connection starts
